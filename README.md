# Blocks Reloaded

## 📝 Overview

Blocks Reloaded is inspired by the original Leap Motion's Blocks demo. The goal was to bring that same playful and intuitive experience into the world of visionOS, using hand tracking, spatial audio, and RealityKit.

Blocks Reloaded lets you create Blocks (currently only cubes) with hand gestures that you can stack on top each other and is a great demonstration of what's possible with the physics engine available in RealityKit.
